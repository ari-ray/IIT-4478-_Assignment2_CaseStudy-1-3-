## Case Studies  

### Case Study 1 — Campus Café Checkout  
A simple **point-of-sale console** for a campus café.  
**Features:**
A Python program is required to be built that simulates a simple checkout system for the
campus café. A customer can view menu, add items to cart, view cart and finally checkout. The
program con@nues @ll the user wants to exit. The program must show line items, subtotal, tax
(10%) and finally the total at the checkout. It can also apply a student’s discount (5%) if eligible.
For the op@onal requirements, it can also consider the number of items ordered and process
accordingly. It can also display the unique categories in a set and apply a meal deal if both food
and drink is present.

### Case Study 2 — Smart Classroom Monitor  
A program to monitor classroom attendance, equipment, and environment.  
**Features:**
A Python program is required to be built that monitors a classroom. It needs to keep a track of
the room state like the status of the projector, capacity and topic. It also needs to keep an
attendance list. It needs to alert if the room is full, if the temperature is too cold or hot, topic set but projector is oﬀ. It should display a menu through which the user can interact
and perform various funcIon like toggle projector, seJng the topic, adding student to room,
removing student from the room, temperature records. So the funcIons are:
1. Track projector and equipment status
2. Track current a=endance
3. Track current room capacity
4. Let the user select the topic of the class
5. Keep the temperature log of the room and provide staIsIcs and report
6. Raise alerts accordingly
7. Display a Menu from where the user can select the aforemenIoned features to access
them and give necessary inputs while geJng the necessary outputs

### Case Study 3 — Boolean Circuit Equivalence  
A logic problem based on Boolean circuits.  
**Features:**
- Translate given circuits (a and b) into Boolean expressions (step-by-step from a) to j))  
- Implement Python simulation that accepts inputs A, B, C → outputs X, Y  
- Write truth tables for both circuits  
- Prove both circuits are equivalent using truth tables
